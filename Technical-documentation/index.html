        <header>Grip</header>
        <p>The way you grip the badminton racket is crucial to executing various shots efficiently. There are a few standard grips used in the sport:</p>
        <p>The most common grips are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forehand Grip: This is the basic grip for most shots, including clears and smashes.</li>
          <li>Backhand Grip: Used for backhand strokes, like the backhand clear and drop.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>To hold a forehand grip, place your thumb on the back bevel of the handle, with your fingers wrapping around the racket's handle in a relaxed but firm hold.</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Footwork">
        <header>Footwork</header>
        <p>Good footwork is essential for positioning yourself to hit accurate and powerful shots. It involves efficient movement around the court.</p>
        <p>Key footwork techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Split Step: This is a quick jump or step just before your opponent strikes the shuttlecock. It helps you react quickly to their shot.</li>
          <li>Side Steps: Use side steps to cover the lateral distance when moving across the court.</li>
          <li>Cross Step: A movement where one foot crosses over the other to move quickly towards the shuttlecock.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Footwork Example: After hitting a forehand shot, take a quick side step to regain your balance and prepare for the next shot.</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Serve">
        <header>Serve</header>
        <p>The serve is the first shot in every rally, and it can be used strategically to gain an advantage over your opponent.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of serves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High Serve: Aiming deep into your opponent's backcourt, usually used in doubles play.</li>
          <li>Low Serve: Aiming short to the opponent's frontcourt, typically used in singles play.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>Example: To perform a high serve, stand near the baseline, use an underhand motion, and ensure the shuttlecock crosses the net at a steep angle.</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Shots">
        <header>Shots</header>
        <p>Badminton offers a wide variety of shots, each designed to put pressure on your opponent.</p>
        <p>Some common shots include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear: A high shot that lands in the backcourt, often used to reset the rally.</li>
          <li>Smash: A powerful overhead shot that forces the shuttlecock downward into the opponent's court.</li>
          <li>Drop Shot: A soft shot that just clears the net, aiming to land in the frontcourt.</li>
          <li>Drive: A fast, flat shot aimed at the opponent's midcourt.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>In badminton: clear sends the shuttle high and deep, smash delivers a fast downward hit, drop makes a soft short shot, drive sends a quick flat shot, and net shot plays gently near the frontcourt.</code>
