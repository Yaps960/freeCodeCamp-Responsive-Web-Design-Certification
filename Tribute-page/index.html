      <p>When she was young, she was fascinated by the grace and beauty of human movement. Under her grandmother's tutelage, she learned the traditional silk dances of her provinceâ€”though she was dubious of their supposedly mystical connection to the Spirit of Ionia, Irelia's love for the dances was real. Seeking to master the art, she eventually left home to study with some of Ionia's most respected performers at the Placidium of Navori.</p>

<p>Irelia's people were peaceful and sought harmony with their neighbors, but rumors of foreign invaders sighted off the coast unsettled many at the Placidium. Irelia returned to her village to find it already occupied, with steel-helmed soldiers from distant Noxus shoving unarmed civilians through the streets with the butts of their spears. The Noxian Admiral Duqal had seized the Xan home to quarter his fleet officers.</p>

<p>Irelia's brothers and her father Lito had evidently protested; her entire family now lay in unmarked graves, in the gardens.</p>

<p>Ravaged by grief, the young girl saw Duqal's men hauling valuables from the house. Among the loot was a large metal crest, depicting the Xan family emblem. Irelia raced to it, wrenching it from Noxian hands. The admiral himself hurled her to the ground, and had his warriors shatter the crest with a heavy iron maul, before ordering them to dig a fresh grave for this upstart child.</p>
